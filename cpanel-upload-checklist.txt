ðŸ“‹ CPANEL UPLOAD CHECKLIST

BEFORE UPLOADING:
â–¡ Project has been built (npm run build completed)
â–¡ dist folder contains all necessary files
â–¡ .htaccess file is present in dist folder

UPLOAD PROCESS:
â–¡ Login to cPanel
â–¡ Open File Manager
â–¡ Navigate to public_html folder
â–¡ Clear existing files (if fresh install)
â–¡ Upload ALL contents from dist folder
â–¡ Do NOT upload the dist folder itself, only its contents

FILES TO VERIFY AFTER UPLOAD:
â–¡ index.html (main file)
â–¡ .htaccess (for routing)
â–¡ aviator.png (favicon)
â–¡ assets/index-[hash].css (styles)
â–¡ assets/index-[hash].js (JavaScript)
â–¡ _redirects (backup routing)

PERMISSIONS:
â–¡ Set folders to 755
â–¡ Set files to 644
â–¡ Apply to all subdirectories

TESTING:
â–¡ Visit your domain (without /index.html)
â–¡ Check if login works
â–¡ Test game functionality
â–¡ Verify all pages load correctly
â–¡ Check browser console for errors

COMMON ISSUES:
- Blank page = Check .htaccess and file paths
- 404 errors = Verify .htaccess is uploaded
- Assets not loading = Check file permissions
- Login not working = Clear browser cache

SUCCESS INDICATORS:
âœ… Site loads at your domain
âœ… Login modal appears
âœ… Game interface is visible
âœ… All buttons and features work
âœ… No console errors in browser
